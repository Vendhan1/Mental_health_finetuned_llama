If you are interested in doing more with this exercise, several variations are available. For example, instead of letting the subjects return to the base rate, you can attempt to force a faster return by having them write a relaxing essay (e.g., a picnic, a day at the beach) at the beginning of the 7th minute.

Whenever psychologists have studied emotional expression, some have maintained that the expression of emotion is learned and is therefore unique to each culture. Others agree with Charles Darwin, who maintained that because facial expressions are biologically based, one can find universality in expression.\nWhichever position is true, it is generally agreed that the face provides the most signals for expression of emotions. The forehead, eyebrows, eyelids, cheeks, nose, lips, and chin all serve to give clues to the feelings one is experiencing. There appear to be 'rules' individuals use to 'read' faces, but seldom can they verbalize those rules. These have not been learned in a systematic way; instead, they are picked up by chance from one's family.\nThe purpose of this demonstration is to help students evaluate how well they are able to identify what emotion is being expressed in a facial expression. If time allows, students could try to list the 'rules' they used to determine what emotion was being expressed."}, "94": {"generated": [{"question": "What are the six emotions Ekman identified, and what is their corresponding facial expression?", "answer": "The six emotions identified by Ekman are surprise, fear, disgust, anger, happiness, and sadness. Each emotion has a distinct facial expression."}, {"question": "How many practice faces did Ekman compile for each emotion?", "answer": "Ekman compiled anywhere from 20 to 40 practice faces for each of the six emotions."}], "context": "Materials\nTeachers should obtain a copy of Ekman and Friesen's (1975) Unmasking the Face. On pages 175-201, Ekman compiled a set of practice faces that express one or more of the following six emotions: surprise, fear, disgust, anger, happiness, and sadness. Cut out the pictures (anywhere from 20 to 40 of the pictures) and paste them on index cards, as suggested by the author. Be certain to write the correct number on the back of the index cards so that it will be possible to look up the correct answers listed on pages 130-134. Judgment sheets (see Handout 5.1) are to be duplicated and distributed to the students."}, "95": {"generated": [{"question": "What do flashing faces refer to in the context of Linda Winchell's profile?", "answer": "Flashing faces are a reference to a common online behavior where individuals post photos of their friends or acquaintances in compromising situations, often without consent."}, {"question": "Who is Linda Winchell and what is her age mentioned?", "answer": "Linda Winchell is an individual whose profile mentions that she is 40 years old."}, {"question": "What information can be inferred about Linda's online activity from the provided data chunk?", "answer": "From the data, it appears that Linda Winchell has engaged in flashing faces behavior, as mentioned in her profile."}, {"question": "What type of information is typically found on profiles like Linda Winchell's?", "answer": "Profiles such as Linda Winchell's often include personal details, online activities, and demographic information about the individual."}, {"question": "Can you describe the purpose of flashing faces in online behavior according to the provided data chunk?", "answer": "Unfortunately, the provided data does not explicitly explain the purpose or motivations behind flashing faces.

At this time it might be helpful to define the terms contempt and disgust on the judgment sheets, as many students have difficulty with the differences in these terms. Shuffle the cards and show them one at a time to the class. Ask your students to make a quick judgment in each case as to which emotion listed on the judgment sheet is expressed in the face.\nWhen you are finished with all the cards, refer to page 130 of Unmasking the Face and slowly read the correct answer for each of the faces. Students are to circle each judgment they have correct. Count totals and record that number on the judgment sheet. Count the number of each of the emotions labeled correctly by the whole class and record that number in the blank next to emotion."}, "97": {"generated": [{"question": "What was the primary goal of distributing photos with shuffled arrangements to assess students' ability to identify emotions in faces?", "answer": "The goal was to provide a variety of emotional expressions and test whether placement affected their ability to read."}, {"question": "Can you identify which emotion was commonly misinterpreted by students according to the distribution chart results?", "answer": "According to the distribution chart, [insert emotion name] was correctly identified least often by students."}], "context": "DisCussion\n1. Make a distribution chart showing the total number of correct judgments for each card. Discuss how well or poorly the students were able to identify emotions expressed. What do these results say about their abilities to 'read' faces? Were some of the expressions easier than the others? Photos were shuffled and arranged randomly to provide a variety of the eight labels; did placement make some emotions easier to read? Ask each student which emotion he or she identified correctly most often. Make a distribution chart and then note trends with possible explanations.\n2. Ask students which emotion they correctly identified least often; note trends with possible explanations.\n3. If there is time, students can analyze the pictures displaying certain emotions to see if they can list the 'rules' they used to 'read' the faces.\n4.
